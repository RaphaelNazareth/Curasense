# Curasense
The Curasese is a machine learning model that can predict possible diseases based on text descriptions of symptoms. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model will analyze and interpret sentences describing symptoms and map them to specific disease labels. This involves preprocessing and cleaning the text data, followed by feature extraction through NLP methods such as TF-IDF or word embeddings, to capture the nuanced relationship between symptoms and diseases. The model will be trained as a text classifier, optimized to accurately predict diseases based on symptom descriptions and evaluated with performance metrics like accuracy and F1-score. This project holds potential applications as an initial diagnostic tool, supporting healthcare professionals in preliminary assessments and offering a reference point for users seeking insights into their symptoms.
